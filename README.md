# Victoria-3-TraitsCheatInteraction

This is a simple Victoria 3 mod that allows user to add or remove traits on a character from CharacterInteractions menu.

## Features:

### Add Traits
- Personality traits can be added to any characters
- Military General traits can only be added to characters with the specified role
- Traits that are already in characters will not trigger the traits mod of that specific trait
- Certain traits are interlocked together based on the game's code, such as Artillery Commander, where only one of the traits can be used at any time

### Remove Traits
- Using a simple logic, the remove trait triggers if it detects that the character had the associated traits.
